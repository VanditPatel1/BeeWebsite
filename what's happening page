  <h2> What's Happening ? </h2>
  <p>Bees form an integral part of our ecosystem as they contribute to almost 30% of the food we eat and in production of 90% of plants around the world. In the US bees pollinate over $15 billion worth of crops each year. But since the last decade, there has been a rapid decline in the population of bees. Almost 40% of the commercial honeybee population have disappeared since 2006 in the US. This alarming rate of disappearance of the bee population has disastrous implications for food availability and the economy globally.
